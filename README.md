Just run the binary from game/bin if you are on Windows 64-bit.

If you are on Linux, we didn't compile a binary. But you can easily run the project in Godot Engine itself by opening project.godot.

IDK, don't steal it

# How to play
"W" and "S" to steer the car.

# Game 
In this game you will be driving a car until you reach your destination. Be careful though as on your way there will be many animals and other cars. As a pacifist, you really don't want to kill anybody. Driving into a car or into animal will cause the game to restart. So be sure not to drive over the animals!... or cars. 

# Engine
